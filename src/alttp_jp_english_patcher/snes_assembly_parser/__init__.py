"""A library for parsing and rewriting asar-compatible SNES assembly.

The unit everything is built around is :class:`Assembly` (one editable, sized,
addressable run of :class:`Line`); :class:`Rom` composes many of them into a
whole program. ``Source``/``Segment`` remain as the previous split and are kept
for compatibility.

Attributes:
    __version__: The installed distribution version.
