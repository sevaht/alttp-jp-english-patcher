"""The :class:`Rom` -- a whole program assembled from many source files.

A :class:`Rom` is built from an entry file (``main.asm``), following every
``incsrc`` into a per-file :class:`~.assembly.Assembly` *unit* (cycle-checked).
It indexes every top-level function and pool across all units, and every
reference to them, so it can answer whole-program questions ("who calls this?")
that a single file cannot. That is what makes *hooking* automatic: freeing a JP
routine's name and pointing its callers at a relocated copy needs to know
whether any caller reaches it with a bank-local ``JSR`` (which cannot cross
banks) and so needs a landing-pad bridge.

Editing a routine is done on its unit's :class:`~.assembly.Assembly`; the
``Rom`` adds the operations that span files: :meth:`~Rom.rename` (label only,
callers untouched), :meth:`~Rom.hook`, free-space, and writing units back.
